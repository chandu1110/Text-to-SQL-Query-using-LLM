# Text-to-SQL-Query-using-LLM
This LLM-powered web app converts natural language questions into SQL queries. Built with **Streamlit** and **Gemini 2.5 Pro**, it allows users to query a student database by typing in plain English. The app translates the request, executes the SQL query against a **SQLite** database, and displays the results in a user-friendly table.
