# Text-to-SQL-Query-using-LLM
This LLM-powered web app converts natural language questions into SQL queries. Built with **Streamlit** and **Gemini 2.5 Pro**, it allows users to query a student database by typing in plain English. The app translates the request, executes the SQL query against a **SQLite** database, and displays the results in a user-friendly table.
Here is a description for a Text-to-SQL LLM web application, focusing on its real-world use cases.

### **1. Description of the Text-to-SQL LLM Web Application**

This web application is an intelligent tool that bridges the gap between natural language and structured data. Powered by a **Large Language Model (LLM)** like **Gemini 2.5 Pro**, it translates plain English questions into **accurate SQL queries**. Users, even those without any knowledge of SQL or database management, can simply type a question (e.g., "How many students are in the 'Data Science' class?") and the application will generate the correct SQL command, execute it, and display the results. This makes data retrieval and analysis accessible to a much broader audience.

### **2. Real-World Use Cases**

The ability to query databases using natural language has transformative applications across various industries:

* **Business Intelligence & Data Analysis:** Business users, marketing managers, and executives often need quick insights from company databases but lack the technical skills to write SQL. A Text-to-SQL tool allows them to independently generate reports on sales figures, customer demographics, or product performance, freeing up data analysts for more complex tasks.

* **E-commerce & Retail:** Store managers can ask questions about inventory levels, customer purchasing trends, or the best-selling products in a specific region without needing to go through a tech team. This enables faster, data-driven decisions on a day-to-day basis.

* **Customer Support & CRM:** Customer service representatives can quickly look up customer history, order details, or support ticket status by asking simple questions, improving response times and efficiency. Instead of navigating complex CRM systems, they can use a natural language interface.

* **Healthcare & Research:** Medical professionals and researchers can query patient databases to analyze treatment outcomes, disease prevalence in a specific demographic, or medication effectiveness without needing a data scientist. This accelerates research and improves administrative workflows. 

* **Financial Services:** Financial analysts and managers can easily query transaction records, investment portfolio performance, or customer account details to identify trends, assess risks, and generate compliance reports. The tool simplifies access to complex financial data, which is often stored in relational databases.
